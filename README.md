# Hello ${person}!

## What in god's name are you? 

<img src="groundhog.png" width="20" />: We're a random collection of people who on ocasion put their code in one place. [@cfv1984][1] started this because some of his friends sucked at this whole version control thing. So "we" are [@groundhogs][2]

## What's with the avatar?

<img src="groundhog.png" width="20" />: Not having a single face is hard, so we made one up ü§∑‚Äç

## What do you even do?

<img src="groundhog.png" width="20" />:We specialize in stuff and dabble in nonsense. One of our nicest things is a Parcel starter kit called [Firestarter <img src="https://github.com/groundhogs/firestarter/blob/master/static/firestarter.png" width="20" />][3] but we do like putting other nicer stuff up from time to time.
